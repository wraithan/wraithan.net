############

This is the next gen of my site, wraithan.net. It is powered by Pelican_. It is
divided into 3 sections:

* Beta_ - The aggregation of the blogs for now until I get the blogger posts
  imported and the kinks worked out.
* Life_ - Where I rant about real life things like bicycling, losing weight,
  relationships, names, etc.
* SC2_ - Where I talk about StarCraft 2, topics such as: practice regime,
  esports events, tools I've written, etc.
* Tech_ - Where I brag about the cool things I build and the nitty gritty
  details about how I got them done.

If I know you, and you have a blog and want to be on my blogroll open an issue
with the link. I reserve the right to remove your blog if it stops being
updated or you are a jerk to me some time.
