This site is an aggregate of 3 blogs, described below:

Life
----

This will be your standard blog, talking about interesting (to me) observations
about my life, people in general, goals and aspirations, music, etc. This will
likely only be interesting to my friends and family (and maybe not even them)
so if you mostly know me from the tech or SC2 worlds then you might want to
just skip this one.

Tech
----

This will focus on things I am building, tech I am using, or tips and tricks
for various libraries and frameworks I use. There will also be commentary on the
tech industry as a whole. Lots of my writing about work will be here. 

SC2
---

I am a Silver league Protoss player in HotS and I am looking to make myself
better. This blog will be the things I figure out about myself as far as
practicing and advancing myself goes. Periodically, it will be bragging about
promotions or wins in tournaments but for the most part I hope to stick to
writing about the learning process.
