:title: Heart of the Swarm: Player vs AI

Spent a bit of time tonight playing the new Player vs AI. It is pretty
fun. It makes you play through the difficulties until you hit the
Elite level at which point it maxes out. Now I am not a great player
but I am evidently good enough to be the AI at the highest level PvAI
goes to, but despite that it doesn't mean it isn't valuable to me.

I even learned while playing through the lower levels of PvAI. The
hard computer hit me with a 6-8 roach timing attack and I barely held
it. I realize my build was rather deficient! It had gaping holes that
hadn't been capitalized on during ladder sessions, because the builds
that could, had fallen out of favor in recent history. It is wonderful
to see this because it made me rearrange and tighten up my build a
bit. I was excited to play against the harder AIs and see what else I
missed!

In HotS, the AI has been taught to use multiple builds, so no longer
does it do the same thing every time. Sometimes you are against a bio
early pushing Terran AI, other times the Terran AI comes at you with
hellions followed up by heavy mech play. This variety lets you test
how a build does, and what it needs to be able to react to at minimum
to survive on the ladder.

With this new tool, I am going to take some time to figure out what
build I am going to use in each match up. After that, work out a
couple transitions in the build to account for the opponent's tech.
Then practice the hell out of them so they are super tight. At that
point they'll be ready for the ladder.

`Day[9]`_ has stated that a very tight build, even if it isn't a great
build, will get you really far. TheJaKaTaK_ asserts that with good
mechanics you'll go a long way. Perhaps if I combine these:

* Solidify and tighten up my builds for each match up to the point
  that I know them so well I don't have to think about placement of
  things, order of buildings, scout timings, etc.
* Work my way through TheStaircase_ getting my mechanics and
  understanding of the various units to be stronger.

Alternating between these, perhaps using one to warm up for the other
is likely where I'll go with this. It seems like a great vehicle to
carry me on the road to HotS Gold League and perhaps, with enough
effort, even Platinum League before the game is released.
