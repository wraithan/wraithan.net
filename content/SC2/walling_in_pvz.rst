:title: Walling in PvZ

:status: draft

I played PvZ a couple times tonight and wanted to try going gateway, cyber,
mama core, expo, into archon/chargelot. While it was very effective at killing
their army. It was not effective at keeping it around. Both cases they just ran
by and went about killing stuff in my base.

Thus is the importance of walling. If I had a proper wall with a sentry or two
I could have kept their zerglings and rouches where I wanted them. Instead, I
lost because I couldn't control them.

I am glad I did the experiment though. I think I will continue with this build
but build my second, third and fourth gateways on my natural ramp to all
