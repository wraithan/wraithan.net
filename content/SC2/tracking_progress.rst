:title: Tracking my Progress

This will be my blog for tracking my progress in StarCraft 2. I find myself
wanting more direction in what I am working on. In turn the goal of this blog
will be for me to talk about what I am going to focus on in the next
week. There will be other topics like build orders I am using, tools I've
built, games I am particularly proud of or highlight mistakes I've made, and
other SC2 and eSports related things.

To chronicle the start of this journey, I am Wraithan. I have fully switched to
playing Heart of the Swarm beta (HotS) as I am the Captain of Mozilla's After
Hours Gaming League (AHGL) team, which is taking place in the beta. I am
currently in Bronze league and look forward to rising up over time as I
improve.
