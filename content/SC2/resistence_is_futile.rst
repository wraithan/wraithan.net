One of the first things that is brought up in art of learning is the how the
author had started learning on their own with some poor habits that he fought
his teacher about. I find the same issue in my SC2 playing. Going sky toss has
generally resulted in my floating too many resources. Along with that i don't
micro my units. I a-move them and then go do other things or even worse, sit
back and watch the battle without using my abilities like Guardian Shield or
Force Fields, or Blink!

This results in a really poor exchange for me. I play slow so I try to avoid
things that I have to speed up my play more for. I don't take it well when
people criticize this part of my play because I feel helpless to it. This is
something that I am going to have to let go of because maintaining it will
result in a very hard ceiling for my skill.

One of the first things I am going to do is start purposefully using builds
that require me to play faster. My macro isn't terrible for my league but my
unit control and composition is terrible so I need to really work on that. Also
my builds are super sloppy and I need to take the time to really learn the
ordering of things in an ideal world so if I am given the chance I can get
really far ahead, and if i am not I can at least be at my maximal power at all
times.
