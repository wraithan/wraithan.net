One of the first things that is brought up in `The Art of Learning`_ is the how
the author had started learning chess on his own and had developed some bad
habits. Then, once he had a real teacher, he fought that teacher about the best
ways to do things. I find the same issue in my SC2 playing.

Commonly on my stream someone will suggest that I add voidrays or full on
skytoss. Or they comment on how I don't micro at all and just a-move my army
everywhere. These are things that are definitely holding me back. I've stopped
doing these things at one point or another because I don't feel confident in
them and my methods have worked so far to make me better.

I play slow (low APM) so I try to avoid things that I have to speed up my play
more for. I don't take it well when people criticize this part of my play
because I feel helpless to it. This is something that I am going to have to let
go of because maintaining it will result in a very hard ceiling for my skill.

Going forward I am going to spend a little time each practice session pushing
my boundaries. Doing phoenix harass, oracle harass, prism play, blink micro,
etc. If I never do it, I'll never be comfortable when I need to do it. If I
push myself to learn it, then I will get a chance to internalize things I am
slow at so I can do them at a faster rate.
