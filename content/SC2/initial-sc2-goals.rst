Also my probe production has a pretty steep drop off after I have a few buildings to look after, especially once I have taken my natural.<br /><br /><b>Solution: </b>I plan on working on this by tracking my average unspent resources and aiming to lower it to a reasonable level. I need initial stats before I can say where I want it in a month</dd><br /><dt>Keeping my calm under early pressure.</dt><dd><b>Problem:</b> Cheese gets me worse than it should.

Together the two make it so cheese eventually destroys me.<br /><br /><b>Solution: </b>I plan on working on this while laddering and during my Saturday night practice sessions with my friends.</dd></dl>Both are things I can continually improve on, they are fundamentals.
