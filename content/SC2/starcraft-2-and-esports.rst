    I've recently found camaraderie with some fellow software developers who play StarCraft 2. Not only that but they get excited to stay up late and watch the big league matches. Note these are people with solid careers, some of them even with a significant other and children. These are not the living in mom's basement, unemployed or working a dead end job and the other general stereotypes of people who get really into video games.<br /><br />I'd been considering whether I wanted to start taking my SC2 playing a bit more seriously and try to push myself into being halfway decent at the game. I waffled back and forth until I watched <a href="http://blip.tv/day9tv/day-9-daily-100-my-life-of-starcraft-3505715">Day[9]'s #100 Daily</a>. I challenge anyone to watch this and not get (at various points) choked up, excited, happy, and finally no longer ashamed of their love of video games.<br /><br />I've been a gamer most of my life, but I play that card close to my chest. Tell someone that not only do you play a game 4-5 hours a week, you don't just call it playing it is practicing and training. You'll probably not enjoy the reaction. Especially since if you are willing to spend time practicing, you have likely become pretty passionate about it.<br /><br />The above video and <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0088000/">Revenge of the Nerds</a> both have something in common. Nerding out on something can be great, especially if it is something that makes you happy. Programming is that way for me, which has led to some great opportunities and friendships, perhaps SC2 will be the same.<br /><br />I have no delusions of becoming a pro gamer, I'll be taking it more serious but not that seriously. My goal is to make it into Master league, meaning top 2% of players in my region (North America). I'm currently Gold league so I still have a long way to go. If you play SC2, add me on Battle.net: Wraithan + 968.
