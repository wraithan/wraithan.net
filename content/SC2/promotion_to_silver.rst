:title: Promoted to Silver

I was pretty bummed when I was placed in HotS and got placed into
Bronze. In WoL I was Silver and the MMR tool said I was nearing
Gold. So a placement into Bronze was almost a slap in the face. It
made me want to quit playing right there.

Instead I started playing more and more, and found that I really
belonged there. I was losing a majority of my matches still. Learning
to deal with all these new units and buffs and nerfs to various
abilities and didn't deserve my previous rank.

Last night I was promoted to Silver. This is after 69 ranked games of
HotS (this is not counting my unranked games and 1v1 with friends). I
have been learning quite a bit while playing those 69 games. Some of
it was getting better at countering various units. Some of it was just
playing more so I can flesh out my playing style and my builds. And
finally, lots of it was watching players like Wilko_ stream.

Next steps will be getting a bit more comfortable with skytoss, at
least mixing it into my composition a little bit. As well as sitting
down and playing with my build orders in a sandbox so I can figure out
what order I should build things and what is the fastest I can
complete it.

I am trying to stream at least an hour or two a day. You can the link
to my twitch account in the side bar to the left.
