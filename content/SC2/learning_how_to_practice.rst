:title: Learning How to Practice

I've been pondering how to get better at SC2. There are a lot of opinions on
this, watch soandso's videos, use one generic build for everyone that teaches
the basics, don't care about mirco or winning and learn to macro, etc. I have
been having trouble deciding between these and/or how to mix and match them so
I feel like I am improving.

The first thing that comes to mind for improving myself is just playing
more. I need to get to the point where I am getting several matches in on
several days a week. I think of this as akin to eating better or going to the
gym. What you do at the gym for those first couple weeks while you get used to
going regularly is less important than building up the habit of doing it.

My next plan for improving is to play more on `my stream`_ and just listen to
advice of people who are watching. I've not been good at this and in fact I
rebel against their advice. While I can't implement everything people suggest,
I can work toward what they suggest and take it under advisement. My
predisposition against certain units that are more micro heavy or I've had a
hard time incorporating is no reason to just reject what a viewer suggests.

In that vein of thinking, it was noted on my stream that I don't generally
micro. In the interest of becoming more comfortable with microing I've started
playing `Darglein's Micro Trainer`_. Playing though all the levels a couple times
then focusing on Blink Stalkers, SCV Train, and Multiple Ability
Control. Partially because I don't even know how to do this effectively and
partially because I need to teach my hands to do this. With the game timer, I
figure if I do an hour of concentrated practice a day, my micro and mouse
control will improve and I'll feel more confident in using my unit's spells.

Finally, there is TheStaircase_, which is a very interesting way to learn to
play. Unfortunately, because I play HotS, I am forced to make a best guess at
my income rate so I can calculate SQ. This will be this way until GGTracker_
supports HotS which I hope will be in the near future. I am in the process of
`building a site`_ that will be able to harness GGTracker's automatic gathering
of SQ for people (both the collective averages by league and for the individual
player) so that you can see if you are passing or not. That said, because I am
playing in the AHGL_ I can't purely use this as I need to have my build orders
refined for real play.

This is the start of my thoughts on training. I am going to go back and re-read
`The Art of Learning`_ and see what thoughts and ideas come from that and
adjust accordingly.
