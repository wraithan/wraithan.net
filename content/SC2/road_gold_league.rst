The Road to Gold League

This will be my blog for tracking my progress in StarCraft 2. I find myself
wanting more direction in what I am working on. In turn the goal of this blog
will be for me to talk about what I am going to focus on in the next week. There
will be other topics like build orders I am using, tools I've built, games I am
particularly proud of or highlight mistakes I've made, and other SC2 and eSports
related things.

Since this is new, it seems introductions are in order, I am Wraithan. I play on
NA and am Silver league at time of this post. The majority of the time I play as
Protoss, but I also have a smurf account where I play as Terran. I am currently
training for AHGL Season 3, I am on Mozilla's SC2 team. Also, I have recently
started playing in BSG (Bronze, Silver, and Gold) tournaments on z33k to get my
feet wet in tournament-land.

My plan is to have 4 solid builds, one for each of: Protoss, Terran, Zerg, and
Random Zerg. The reason why I don't need builds for Random Protoss or random
Terran is due to my opening for Random being the same as my opening for my
regular matchup with those races.

Anyway, I'll track my progress is subsequent blog posts.
