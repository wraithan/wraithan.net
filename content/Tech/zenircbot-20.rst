    Today marks the day when the bot's API should only expand, without removing or changing the currently available messages that the core bot sends.<br /><br /><i>admin.js </i>now uses <i>forever</i> a Node library for process management akin to runit, god, or supervisord. The big win with <i>forever</i> over those others is that it has both a command line interface as well as the ability to use it as a library. This lets <i>admin.js</i> no longer have to shell out to fabric which shelled out to tmux (you can see why I replaced it).<br /><br />The types of messages that the bot emits is still more limited than I'd like, but I can add to the API without making backwards incompatible changes. Also the bot is still just a neat bot not a useful one for most people. This will hopefully be changing in the near future.<br /><br />If you are following the development or using the bot yourself, these are some things you should know. First off, <i>master</i> should remain stable now. All development will take place on <i>develop</i> and in branches. Once I am done with a feature I'll merge it into master and tag it with the version. Versioning will work as follows: x.y.z<br /><ul><li><b>x</b> will change if there is a backwards incompatible change in the bot. This includes config, protocol, and services API changes that are backwards incompatible.</li><li><b>y </b>will change if there is a change to the core bot and its protocols that is backwards compatible. This means if I add any new message types or options that default to how behavior worked before you'll see a <b>y </b>version change.</li><li><b>z</b> will change when it is just a service changing. For now these wont ever trigger a <b>y</b> or <b>x</b> change unless it is pretty drastic. This may change in the future.</li></ul>Also, if you use the bot, or would if there were certain features/services available, please post them as issues on GitHub. If you like it or want to discuss it, let's hear about it in the comments or in #pdxbots on Freenode.
