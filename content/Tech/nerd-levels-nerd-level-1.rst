Wing it.<br />16:00:29 [C]Niall | Write crap if you want to write crap.<br />16:00:35 Wraithan | sometimes i feel like just diving in and fuck those who don't get it, other times I feel bad and want to make it so everyone an understand<br />16:00:46 [C]Niall | Do it all.<br />16:00:56 Wraithan | Maybe I should put a level as part of the name<br />16:00:56 Wraithan | haha<br />16:01:21 [C]Niall | Yeah.<br />16:01:23 [C]Niall | Good plan.<br /></span><br /><br />Alright, from now I plan on tagging each title with a nerd level. Sometimes I want to go in-depth on programming topics and well, most of my friends wont get it. Other times I am doing light hearted posts and/or explaining different technical things in ways I hope the majority can understand.<br /><br />Not going to list all the levels, just going to put tiers.<br />Nerd Level 1: This will be stuff anyone can understand, or hopefully anyone can, ping me on IM/IRC/comments if something doesn't make sense in one of these, so I can improve my writing.<br /><br />Nerd Level 5: This will be moderately technical stuff, such as computer parts and linux software and what not.<br /><br />Nerd Level 10+: This will be more in-depth programming concepts, examinations into how hardware works, stuff like that.<br /><br />Hopefully this will help, and allow me to explore whatever topics I want.
