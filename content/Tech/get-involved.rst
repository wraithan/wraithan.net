    Getting involved is something I've blogged about a few times on here. Each time has been a pledge to get more involved in the open source community in different ways. I am more involved now than I have ever been previously. I feel comfortable finding an issue in a project, forking it, fixing it and sending a pull request. Also, I find myself writing docs for projects and sending them as pull requests as well.<br /><br />I was reading a <a href="http://alexgaynor.net/2012/jul/04/why-personal-funding/">post</a> from <a href="http://alexgaynor.net/">Alex Gaynor</a> about funding open source developers. I am all for that and in fact am using <a href="https://www.gittip.com/">Gittip </a>to fund several developers. Currently, I only fund each developer $3/week, which only comes out to $13.50 a month for each of them. But, I am unsure how many people I am going to end up funding and want to feel things out a bit before I commit more than that.<br /><br />Now I find myself putting forward a little time and money here and there to various projects but I still don't feel like that is enough. I can't seem to get past the 2-3 commits on a project then walk away mentality that I've built up.<br /><br />My next goal is to become really involved in some project or community, and not because it is convenient but because I find it fun and engaging. In this goal though, I'm not going to beat myself up for not getting deep into a project. Just getting more commits in&#151;be it docs, tests, or actual code&#151;will improve my impact on the community. If I end up just being a nomad who dabbles in many projects but manages to consistently do that, I'm ok with that.
