    <a href="https://github.com/wraithan/zenircbot">ZenIRCBot</a>! I haven't spoken about this for a while on my blog but here I am. I gave a <a href="http://opensourcebridge.org/events/2012/sessions/763">talk on ZenIRCBot</a> yesterday here at <a href="http://opensourcebridge.org/">Open Source Bridge</a>. The talk wasn't great but <a href="http://ericholscher.com/">Eric Holscher</a> also <a href="http://opensourcebridge.org/events/2012/sessions/879">gave a talk</a> and his was fantastic. <br /><br />On to the main topic of this post though, something that I was working on months ago but got side tracked when I decided to finally get a job again is ZenIRCBot 2.2. Most of this update is the change from an internal API to <a href="https://github.com/wraithan/zenircbot-api">ZenIRCBot API</a> being its own beast that is on <a href="http://search.npmjs.org/#/zenircbot-api">NPM</a> and <a href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi/zenircbot_api/">PyPI</a>. The internal API is depreciated and I plan to remove it in 2.4. There will be no continued development on it. Instead the new API libraries will be developed. If you have additional languages that you'd like supported please feel free to write an equivalent library and send a pull request.<br /><br />There should also be better protocol parity across the various versions of the bot (node.js, python and clojure). And the docs should much more closely match what happens, regardless of what version of the bot you are running. This was facilitated by finally writing a way of doing integration testing. It is still pretty new and developing rapidly but it has already served a great purposed.<br /><br />If this release breaks anything for you please let me know, preferably as an <a href="https://github.com/wraithan/zenircbot/issues/new">issue on github</a>.
