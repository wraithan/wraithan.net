    I blogged last month about my goals and where I wanted them to be. In response to that I built a site that helps me track where I am for the 7 days trailing. That site can be found at <a href="http://training.wraithan.net/">http://training.wraithan.net/</a>.<br /><br />Users log into my site via <a href="http://dailymile.com/">Dailymile</a> using OAuth2 since I need to get their API token in order to collect their workouts and display them. You can see my profile at <a href="http://training.wraithan.net/profile/Wraithan">http://training.wraithan.net/profile/Wraithan</a>. At time of writing I am nearing my goal for biking but my running and hiking have suffered.<br /><br />I built this site using Django, I did all the OAuth2 stuff myself because when I last surveyed the existing work with OAuth2 and Django, I found I would have to write my own. I turns out it is pretty simple, and because of the many drafts that exist, it would be pretty trying to have a more generic app for this. This will hopefully change when OAuth2 is finalized.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.dailymile.com/api">Dailymile's API</a> has some warts but it is usable and they were rather responsive when I had some requests for features and the one or two bugs I ran into. Plus their terms of service for their API are really reasonable. I can't say the same about other workout tracking sites I looked into, either they had a horrible ToS or they plain didn't have an API.
