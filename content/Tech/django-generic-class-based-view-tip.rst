    Those reading this via a feed reader will have to view the page on my blog as I am using embedded gists. I'll find a solution for that in the future. <br /><br />So say you have a base template that looks something like: <script src="https://gist.github.com/1659579.js?file=base.html"></script><br />And a template that looks like either of these: <script src="https://gist.github.com/1659579.js?file=home.html"></script><script src="https://gist.github.com/1659579.js?file=other.html"></script><br />It used to be that you could write something like this: <script src="https://gist.github.com/1659579.js?file=old_urls.py"></script><br />But generic function based views are deprecated and the world is being strongly urged to move to generic class based views. If you would like to get extra_content working with the <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/generic-views/#django-views-generic-simple-direct-to-template">direct_to_template</a> replacement <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/class-based-views/#django.views.generic.base.TemplateView">TemplateView</a>, you can use a view like the following: <script src="https://gist.github.com/1659579.js?file=views.py"></script><br />And a urls.py like the following using it: <script src="https://gist.github.com/1659579.js?file=urls.py"></script><br />The code used in this blog post can be found in <a href="https://gist.github.com/1659579">this gist</a>.
