:title: Fabric and why it makes me happier to work on side projects

    Tonight I set out for two goals, to start an app for tracking my progress in preparation for a <a href="http://bicycling.about.com/od/trainingandfitness/a/century.htm">Century Ride</a> in the next few months, and to organize my <a href="http://fabfile.org/">fabfile.py</a> to be more generic. I've started the app, though all it does is let you log into the admin section of the site (using django-admin) which is some success. But the real technical success tonight is my fabfile and how far it has come.<br /><br />I had a monolithic <a href="https://github.com/wraithan/reciblog/blob/master/fabfile.py">fabfile</a> that I have been copying between projects and just search and replacing in, it could (potentially) do a full install of an app, at a push of a button. Really those steps are things that are done (for me at least) once a blue moon. The more valuable part is push button releases. So I reworked it to only include the things I need for development and releases this is the result: <a href="https://github.com/wraithan/century/blob/master/fabfile.py">Century fabfile.py</a><br /><br />The lower the bar, the better for releasing new version of a site I am working on. In the past I had found myself editing python on the live server, then committing back to github as things work. This is poor practice for many reasons... Now, I can finish a feature, close a bug, or clean up code and easily deploy it to the live server with a simple `git push &amp;&amp; fab deploy` The only reason the git push isn't part of the deploy is that sometimes I unpushed code that is not ready for live, and I'd like to be able to deploy without having to worry about that.<br /><br />I highly recommend that you guys check out Fabric, it is really simple to use and will make your life better in many ways.
