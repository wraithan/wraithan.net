    Back in August 2011, I started <a href="https://github.com/wraithan/zenircbot">ZenIRCBot</a> both as a learning experience in <a href="http://nodejs.org/">Node.js</a> and to fill a need which was a IRC bot for personal use as well as for use at <a href="http://aquameta.com/">Aquameta</a>. Since then a few of my friends have picked up using it to have their own IRC bots that they can easily write services for.<br /><br />In other people using it, I got some valuable feedback like using executable config files while sometimes really handy, makes it harder to write services that build on each other in different languages. To this end I plan on changing out the executable config files with pure JSON ones. JSON is already required to communicate via the protocol so this makes sense to me.<br /><br />Another thing that is spawning from others using the IRC bot is I need to start being strict about my versioning. I'll likely go with <a href="http://semver.org/">Semantic Versioning</a> as it is basically what I'd already do but has more formal specification. The config files will be treated as part of the public API, as well as the protocol. This means when I change the configs to be JSON I'll also be bumping the version number to 2.0.0.<br /><br />Other things that will be coming out in the near future are docs for every service, another pass over existing documentation, additional services, a way for services to register themselves, and a new mechanism for running the bot. These things and more are all in the <a href="https://github.com/wraithan/zenircbot/issues?sort=created&amp;direction=desc&amp;state=open">issues</a> on GitHub. If you have any input for additional services that would be useful please feel free to open a ticket, or if you feel so inclined, write it and send a pull request.<br /><br />This project has been the most interesting IRC bot I've ever written. All in all I think this project is going well and I am looking forward to it evolving over the coming months as it get more adoption, better docs, and cleaner code and APIs.
