    Lately I've taken to listening to lots of those podcasts, interviews, and tech talks. It started when I started watching/listening to Google talks more often. I linked one in my earlier posts about CSP and since have watched a whole slew of them.<br /><br />My latest ones I've been listening to is <a href="http://mixergy.com/">Mixergy</a> interviews. The ones I care about and listen to are about folks that start a business from open source software, and/or how popular websites have come into existence.<br /><br />Lots of my ideas and projects fall by the wayside but these interviews have had me thinking about if any of those projects would be viable to start a business from. I think to be able to make money from a project that you really enjoy and get to work on it all day is great.<br /><br />The biggest problem with trying to make money from these things is multifaceted. I love open source and writing code I can't share sucks but it is what sustains me right now so I can't knock it too much. But any code that I would be passionate enough to want to turn into a business I would have to either dual license (free for personal, pay for commercial) which in a lot of cases wouldn't work (little to no commercial interest) or need a pay for service portion (which could also be free personal/pay commercial)<br /><br />The dual license option is moderately common but lots of my projects and libraries I create are for my own enjoyment and I can't see folks paying to include code in their commercial product, nor can I see many ways to do things as a service while maintaining a full open source product other than maybe commercial tech support like some Linux distros use, again that would require lots of commercial interests to be viable though.<br /><br />The other options I have is that I could write closed source code for companies using my open source libraries. That way I could build a framework, set of libraries, and/or tools to manage and write the end application (be it web or otherwise). This way a good portion of the reusable stuff is open source and available to the community but I could still make money by writing software using it.<br /><br />I can do that with my current job to an extent, if I want a tool I can code it up at home, make a release of it, and then use it at work and see if the boss is cool with me spending company time on any other changes/bug fixes it needs. Should it prove useful enough I could see him easily approving that.<br /><br />In closing, I hope to someday have my own business, maybe I will focus on that a bit in college, but for now, I am pretty happy with being able to code all day for money, even if the majority of the code is not open source.
