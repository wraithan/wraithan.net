    Over the last two weeks or so, a ton of development time has gone into <a href="https://github.com/wraithan/zenircbot">ZenIRCBot</a>. At this point it is still more of a neat project than a good IRC bot. But it is rapidly improving, and as I get more adoption I get more embarrassed about the ways that it is rough around the edges. That embarrassment leads to opening tickets and fixing them.<br /><br />My last post I mentioned using&nbsp;<a href="http://semver.org/">SemVer</a> which I didn't really follow through on like I had intended. This is also a point of embarrassment for me. My plan is to get through some more issues and get to where I hope things will stabilize more. I have a <a href="https://github.com/wraithan/zenircbot/issues?sort=created&amp;direction=desc&amp;state=open&amp;page=1&amp;milestone=2">2.0 milestone</a> that is going to be the line in the sand. After that, if I want adoption rates to go up, I have to start tagging versions, developing outside of master and merging in when things are ready, etc.<br /><br />&nbsp;Other interesting news on the project is that there is now a Clojure version of the core bot. It is a git submodule as there were a number of files needed in order to run it, as opposed to the Node or Python bots where they are single files. The Clojure version of the bot is <a href="https://github.com/wraithan/zenircbot-clojure">here</a> and there are <a href="http://zenircbot.readthedocs.org/en/latest/install.html#getting-the-clojure-bot-running">instructions</a> for using it.<br /><br />A final note is if you notice services missing that you expect from a standard IRC bot please open up an issue or even better, write it and send me a pull request. If you need help using, developing, or just want to discuss the bot feel free to hit me up in <a href="irc://chat.freenode.net/#pdxbots">#pdxbots</a> on <a href="http://www.freenode.net/">Freenode</a>. <br /><br /><br />
