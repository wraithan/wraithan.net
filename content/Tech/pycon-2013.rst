:title: PyCon 2013
:date: 2013-03-18

I've spent the last week hanging out in Silicon Valley for PyCon as well as to
hang out with my co-workers. This year's experience was very different from the
previous years, which I can probably attribute to a couple things.

First, I drove down with my friend and co-worker `Rob Hudson`_, which allowed me
to bring my bicycle. Having a way to get around that isn't just relying on the
public transit is pretty amazing. I've gotten lost a few times but overall it
has been pretty fantastic. It also means I am not getting out of the habit of
spending time on my bicycle each morning and evening.

Second, I am sharing a house with co-workers and new friends of mine (Tarek_,
Alexis_, Oliver_, and Julien_) which changes things pretty drastically. I no
longer go back to a lonely hotel room, I have a comfortable house with
friends. I can cook breakfast or dinner, spend time chatting with about code,
projects and linguistics until late into the night, etc. It also means I am
forced to explore the surrounding area a bit since I bike through it.

Finally, I am a Mozilla employee this year. I am not a funemployed guy who has
only worked at small time startups, instead I've worked on a high scale website
at a company that plenty of people can recognize.

It has been a wonderful time at PyCon, I have another day of sprints left, then
I head to MV to hang out with my co-workers for a day before I take the long
train ride back to Portland.
