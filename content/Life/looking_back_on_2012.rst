:title: Looking Back on 2012
:date: 2013-01-03

**January**, I started off this year knowing I was leaving a company I'd been at
for nearly two years. I was setting off to spend time on my side projects,
travel, and figure out what I want to do for the next couple years. The last
month at Aquameta_ was very interesting. I had started brain dumping in December
but didn't realize how much I had stored up in my noggin. Took a lot of time
with my good friend Martin and the Aquameta wiki to get it all out.

This is also the month that I started dating Eva, my current girlfriend. We had
a bump for a while but things have been really good. I've even met a bunch of
her family, but that comes later in the year.

**February** was a month of firsts. I left the Oregon/Washington area for the
first time. Flew on a plane for the first time. Went zip lining for the first
time. 2 weeks were spent in Hawaii with my best friend Tyler. We went zip lining
for his birthday. Spent tons of time in tiki bars and on the beach. Even saw
active lava! This was really far out of my comfort zone, all of this month, but
it was a wonderful experience and gave me the drive to start seeing other
places. Which is what I did the rest of the year!

**March** is when I made it to California for the first time on my longest train
ride to date. Went to my first PyCon_ and hung out with and made a bunch of
friends while I was there. It was a fantastic time. I had my 25th birthday there
and hung out with 2 people I didn't know for most of the day. We got drunk in an
Irish pub drinking Guinness and Jameson.

**April** was when I applied to Mozilla_ as well as a couple other companies. I
had spent February and March working on my resume and writing software, I felt
like it was time to start working again so I dove into that. Mozilla took longer
than I expected though and it was May before I heard back. In that time Janrain_
took interest in me and I interviewed with them and got a job offer.

**May** I started really pushing at Mozilla to see what was going on with my
application. While Janrain would be a fantastic place to work and I have friends
there, Mozilla was really my number 1 choice. Toward the middle of the month I
was getting desperate and my offer from Janrain wouldn't last much longer, but
that is when my current boss `Wil Clouser`_ stepped in to move my application
along. Over the course of Thursday to Tuesday one week I had gone from being
uncertain they even heard my application, to doing a phone interview, then in
person interview then flown down to Mountain View.

That is another notable first. I'd never been flown or otherwise transported to
a place for an interview. They'd always been in Portland and I'd ride my bike or
the bus to their office, talk to some people, maybe get some coffee/lunch, then
go home. They flew me to Mountain View, put me in a hotel and then spent a day
interviewing me and took me out to lunch. It was remarkable to me. The most
remarkable thing though, was that Mozilla saw it fit to hire me. May 28th was my
first day.

**June**, this was a hectic month of learning how to exist as a remote employee
in the hurricane that is Mozilla. Working out how to be remote is something I
should blog on, if only so I think about it more and try to refine
things. Working at Mozilla was what I expected it to be and more. My team I am
on is brilliant. `Andy McKay`_ and `Chris Van`_ in particular were greatly
helpful to me. Andy for being brutal in his code reviews (and I think he was
holding back!) which got my code into the standards needed for Mozilla. cvan for
sending me personal messages checking on me and reassuring me. Without them I
feel like I would have sunk pretty quickly.

Another notable first in June was the fact that I gave my first talk at a
conference! I spoke about ZenIRCBot_ one of the focuses of my time away from the
busy world of working. The talk wasn't wonderful, but I had a co-worker in the
room `Jeff Griffiths`_ who asked great questions to draw me back on track turn
the talk from a potential failure to a success!

**July** was more getting used to working at Mozilla, it was also about the time
I started taking `StarCraft 2`_ a little more seriously. Not as serious as I
take it now, but I was practicing with some regularity and a little bit of
deliberateness. It ended with the start of my first work week and the chance to
meet a lot of my co-workers and teammates that I'd never met before, we had a
good time in Mountain View.

**August** started with the end of my first work week, one of the last night we
found the `diveyist dive bar`_ in Mountain View. That was a good night drinking
with my teammates and wandering around MV. Not an exciting month other than
that, lots of working, lots of SC2.

**September** was my 3rd DjangoCon_. It took me to the east coast for the first
time. I spent a week in Washington DC. I got to hang out with my SC2 friends in
real life for the first time and participate in my first SC2 tournament. I
didn't make it to the finals but I did have the top two players in my bracket so
I am not very worried about that. Besides, come next PyCon I will be placing at
the top of the tournament!

I did the tourist thing and spent time in Washington DC proper looking at the
sites, eating a hot dog from a cart, etc. Other than the terrible weather (90F
with 90% humidity most days then a tornado near by) it was a really fun trip.

Finally it is when I started my Python eating a Ruby tattoo that I am really
happy with and will have the whole series on here when it is finished. This is
my biggest tattoo (and second one) and is probably going to be my biggest tattoo
for a long time.

**October** is when I did `my first AMA`_ on reddit. I got the opportunity due
to it being one for all Mozillians_. It was a lot of fun to try to answer all
the questions that the community had. There were trolls but overall it was a
pretty great experience. A couple more sessions on my tattoo in this month as
well. Pretty much it.

**November** was some more work on my tattoo, then my first time spending what
qualifies as a major holiday in my family away. I went down to Fresno to spend
Thanksgiving with Eva's family. This was a big deal for me. Spending time away
from my family during the holidays was weird but it was really great to get to
meet her family and hang out with them for a few days. It was also different to
be able to eat one of our thanksgiving meals outside since it was so warm!

This month is when I buckled down and decided that I am going to be good at
SC2. That I am going to put in the time and effort. I took over the `Mozilla
After Hours Gaming League`_ team. Started doing concentrated practice and
studying streams. It is also when I started building SC2 tools like SpendingQ_.

**December** had the color completion of my tattoo, a family reunion, and the
first preseason matches of the AHGL_. I took the week of Christmas off to hang
out with family and work on my blog, as well as practice SC2 a bit. This
iteration of my ability to blog came to life toward the end of the month. It has
really awakened the desire to write for me again and it has been a lot of fun.

The last day of the year, I spent with Eva as well as other friends having a
wonderfully fun and relaxing night. We rang in the new year singing `Auld Lang
Syne`_ despite at some point that day getting food poisoning, it was a pretty
great end to the year.

**2013:** I plan to do a looking forward post as well. But this is all I have
about 2012 for now. Thank you all for spending it with me. I had a great time
and feel like I came out a better person than I was when I started, or at the
very least, a more experienced person.
