:title: Flowing Through the Day

`Flow state`_ is an important aspect of my life. I remember slipping into flow
while building things with LEGO as a kid. Then later when executing my best runs
while skateboarding at the skate park. When I was a bit older it was during
tests in school and while writing some of my first programs. These cases were
never intentional though. They happened and it was cool that I got a lot of work
done, then I'd go to do more and flounder.

Later, when I started writing software more seriously, I started to try to
induce this state. Unfortunately, I didn't have words for it, there was just
good focus vs bad focus. One afternoon I was reading a blog post about athletes
and being in the zone, which sort of reminded me of what I knew of when I was
programming. I can't find the post now, but searching for "the zone" let me find
articles about flow.

Since then it has been a journey of trying to find triggers, figure out if any
chemicals like caffeine can assist or hurt. There is a lot of research, but not
a ton of it is good.
