    This is more a personal recording of thoughts than my normal posts that are aimed at an audience.<br /><br />I've begun exercising. I read somewhere that you shouldn't post/talk about starting exercising much until you've actually started and are a few days/weeks in. I am now 3 weeks into biking for training, and I've started walking and even jogged a bit yesterday.<br /><br />I fell short of my 2 of my 3 goals last year. I was able to complete a 100mi ride, while it was very hard it was also easier than I expected. My other 2 goals, jogging 30min straight and swimming a mile straight were over reaching in some ways. The jogging was thwarted by injuring my joints. I didn't start into jogging softly enough. The swimming was defeated by my lack of ability to swim very well.<br /><br />My biking goal this summer is to hit, exceed and maintain 160km per week. I may bump this up as I am already at 100km in a week without much negative impact on my body. I have started, and intend to continue hiking, aiming for a 8km+ hike each week. Running, I want to get to the point that I am doing 5km runs twice a week. And finally I want to reach 750m swimming per week.<br /><br />This is a lot of goals, and I don't know if I'll be able to reach them all, but they culminate in being able to do the Portland Triathlon. I hope to have a page of my training vs my goals and where I am for each thing. Swimming will be waiting until I have a job and can start at a gym again, the rest are started and I hope to continue kicking ass at them.
