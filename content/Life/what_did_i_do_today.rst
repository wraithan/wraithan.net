:title: What Did I Do Today

:status: draft

I have really inconsistent productivity. Some days I am on fire and really
hammering out code. Other days I get to the end and have nothing to show for it
and really have a hard time remembering what I was doing. To this end my boss
and I have decided it would be helpful if at the end of the day I send a report
of progress I made on my bugs.

I opted include some other stuff, both for my boss' sake and for my own tracking
of my day. The basic format of the email is:

    Today:
    * http://bugzil.la/700000 : Wrote some code and made progress.
    * Other stuff: Helped edit someone's blog post
    Tomorrow:
    * http://bugzil.la/800000 : This is my highest priority thing, it should
      only take me 2 hours.
    
    I felt ok about today, I was distracted a bit with IRC questions. I might
    try keeping IRC minimized for parts of the day and only look at it when I am
    highlighted.

After doing this for two days, I'm deciding to do this in other parts of my life
to varying degrees. For SC2, I'll be doing a weekly report, because it is an
approximately equivalent, since I am planning 5-10 hours of SC2 practice a week
and that is near the same as my 6-10 hour work day.

I'm also thinking that I might do this for my bike riding as well. Weekly makes
sense for this as well, because individual rides are less interesting but
looking at them in aggregate I can see some trends and progress.
